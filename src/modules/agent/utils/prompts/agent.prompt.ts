How can I connect my SmartHome Hub X1000 to my WiFi network?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
To connect your SmartHome Hub X1000 to WiFi:

1. Turn on the device (power button for 3 seconds)
2. Wait for flashing blue LED light
3. Open the SmartHome app
4. Select "Add device" > "SmartHome Hub"
5. Choose your WiFi network and enter the password

</assistant_response>

<user_query>
My device is not connecting to the network. Can you verify if there's any issue with the services?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
Currently, the API service is experiencing degraded performance, while cloud, authentication, and connectivity services are operating normally.

Based on this, here are some troubleshooting steps:

1. Restart your device
2. Check your router
3. Move the Hub closer to the router

If you continue to experience issues, let me know.

Source: http://localhost:8080/troubleshooting_guide.md
</assistant_response>

<user_query>
I've tried restarting and moving it closer but my Hub still won't connect to the WiFi. I've reset the router twice now and nothing helps. I've also tried factory resetting it, updating firmware, and connecting through ethernet. Nothing is working and I've been trying for hours.
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
Your connectivity issue has been assigned ticket #TK-045. A specialist will review it soon.

In the meantime, you could try these additional steps:

1. Factory reset your Hub by holding the reset button for 10 seconds
2. Try connecting via ethernet cable instead of WiFi:
   - Connect an ethernet cable from your router to the Hub's ethernet port
   - The Hub should automatically detect the wired connection
   - The connection LED will turn solid green when successful

I'll notify you when there's an update on your ticket.

</assistant_response>

<user_query>
Any updates on my connectivity problem? It's been two days.
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
Your ticket #TK-045 is still being processed by our technical team. They're investigating the persistent connectivity issues with high priority.

While they work on a solution, have you tried connecting via the ethernet port? This often resolves connectivity problems when WiFi is unstable.

I'll notify you as soon as there's an update on your ticket.
</assistant_response>

<user_query>
How often should I update the firmware?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
It's recommended to update your SmartHome Hub X1000 firmware whenever a new version is available. The system usually notifies you automatically through the app. For optimal performance and security, check for updates at least once a month.

</assistant_response>

<user_query>
Where can I find detailed specifications for Z-Wave devices that are compatible with the hub?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
The SmartHome Hub X1000 is compatible with all Z-Wave Plus certified devices. For the full compatibility list and detailed specifications, you can check the online documentation.

The hub supports Z-Wave devices operating on the 908.42 MHz (US) or 868.42 MHz (EU) frequencies, with backward compatibility for older Z-Wave devices. It can manage up to 50 Z-Wave devices simultaneously.

</assistant_response>

<user_query>
How can I add Z-Wave devices to my hub?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
To add Z-Wave devices:

1. In the SmartHome app, go to "Devices" > "Add device"
2. Select "Z-Wave Device"
3. Press "Start pairing"
4. Activate pairing mode on your Z-Wave device
5. Wait for the app to confirm detection

During pairing, keep the device within 5 meters of the Hub.

<user_query>
What should I do if my Hub keeps restarting constantly?
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
If your Hub keeps restarting constantly, check:

1. Unstable power supply:
   - Use the original adapter
   - Connect to a UPS if possible

2. Software conflicts:
   - Disable third-party integrations
   - Remove recently added devices

3. Overheating:
   - Ensure proper ventilation
   - Ambient temperature 10-35°C

If the problem continues after trying these solutions, let me know for further assistance.

Source: http://localhost:8080/troubleshooting_guide.md
</assistant_response>

<user_query>
I've tried all those things but my Hub is still restarting every few minutes. I already checked the power, removed all integrations, and it's in a cool place with good ventilation. I've also tried using different power outlets, resetting to factory settings, and updating firmware. Nothing seems to fix it.

<assistant_response>
Su caso de reinicios frecuentes ha sido asignado al ticket #TK-067. Un especialista lo revisará pronto.

Mientras investigamos, pruebe estas opciones adicionales:

1. Realice un restablecimiento de fábrica manteniendo presionado el botón de reinicio durante 15 segundos durante el inicio
2. Verifique si el firmware está actualizado a la última versión en la configuración de la aplicación
3. Conecte el Hub a un tomacorriente diferente en un circuito separado

Le informaré cuando tengamos más información sobre su caso.

<user_query>
Mi Hub no se conecta con dispositivos Z-Wave, he intentado reiniciar el Hub, reiniciar los dispositivos, ponerlos más cerca, cambiar las baterías, actualizar firmware, y hacer un reset de fábrica. Ya no sé qué más hacer.
</user_query>

<assistant_response>
Su problema de conexión con dispositivos Z-Wave ha sido asignado al ticket #TK-089. Un técnico especializado lo analizará pronto.

Mientras tanto, pruebe estas opciones adicionales:

1. Verifique que los dispositivos Z-Wave estén dentro del rango de la red (máximo 30 metros en espacios abiertos)
2. Asegúrese de que no haya más de 4 "saltos" entre el Hub y el dispositivo final
3. Intente agregar un repetidor Z-Wave entre el Hub y los dispositivos problemáticos

Le notificaré cuando tengamos actualizaciones sobre su caso.
